# CodingQuiz
Description:
This project will test your coding knowledge! You answer the questions as fast and accuratley as you can before the time runs out. However if you pick one wrong answer will take away 10 seconds from your time. Once you have finished the quuiz you can save your score by entering your initals. You can also check back on your scores and see which one you need to beat to be number 1 by clicking on the leaderboard.
This project was definetly a challenge for me! I spent a lot of time researching how to make all these functions and elements work in javascript. I felt lost at times because I was starting from scratch to build this quiz; However after all the hard work I am happy to say that I have a site that works. I can honestly say that I was able to understand JS more in depth through this project.
